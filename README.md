# Covid19_SQL

This project was worked out in frame of Engeto Data Academy course. The goal was to construct a panel data table, which will serve as a hypothetical platform for creation of mathematical model, describing the complex influence of many factors on the course and seriousness of the covid 19 pandemic in the particular countries. The factors include parameters which describe economical level, standard of living, weather and distribution of religion attendees in the countries. Furthermore, also specific parameter that gives an indirect information regarding the historical consequence in the given states is included (namely overall change in life expectancy over the last 50 years) and - of course - the parameters which are linked with the time-aspects. 

## Project solution

The project was written in SQL. The data source was the database _data.engeto.com_, to which I was connected using localhost. As a consequence, the results were not shared between the database users. Therefore, the direct output of the project are SQL scripts, which are designed to be postponed to the second side so that the second side can use the scripts to generate the required object which is the final table, as well as the auxiliary objects. 

### Auxiliary objects

This concept was chosen to help in understanding the creation process and to increase the transparency of the whole work. Rather than building one query using temporary tables, generated by the with clause, the solution contains the particular tables, which must be generated prior to creation of the final table. Although this solution forces the project evaluator to employ himself by creating the particular tables, it also brings him a great advantage to see the root objects from which the final table is generated. In the following text, there is a following typographic convention: 

**The particular tables are written in bold**

***The source tables from data.engeto.com are written in bold italics***

_The columns in the particular tables are written in italics_ 

#### Table of life expectancy

This table is called **t_life_expectancy_data** after it is created. The source data were mined from the table _life_expectancy_, which is a part of database  :
_country_ : This column contains the distinctive field of conutries from the source table
